# VRAIN
The Virtual Reality Agent Interaction Network (VRAIN) is a Unity package that allows users to create intelligent agents with minimal effort.

## TODO
The following is a list of tasks to-do or that are currently in the process of development:
1. JumpManager: adding 'jumps' between Events
2. RotateManager: turn the agent smoothly
3. EmotionCheckManager: based on memory (state of mind)
4. GazeManager: control agent eye-gaze and head movement
5. MemoryCheckManager: alter agent behavior based on memory (interactions with user(s))

### New Features
1. Network Manager: add multiplayer support
