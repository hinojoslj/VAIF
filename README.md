# VRAIN
The Virtual Reality Agent Interaction Network (VRAIN) is a Unity package that allows users to create intelligent agents with minimal effort.

## Short-Term Features In Development
The following is a list of tasks to-do or that are currently in the process of development:
1. JumpManager: adding 'jumps' between Events
2. RotateManager: turn the agent smoothly
3. MemoryCheckManager: alter agent behavior based on memory (interactions with user(s)) -- requires logic/reasoning

### Long-Term Features to Implement
1. Network Manager: add multiplayer support
2. EmotionCheckManager: based on memory (state of mind) -- requires blendshape (facial expressions)
3. GazeManager: control agent eye-gaze and head movement -- requires blendshape (facial expressions)

## History
